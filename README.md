# Connect4Ai
The Ai that learns to play Connect4 by using Markov Chains Monte Carlo Method.
The implementation uses the Monte Carlo methods class of algorithms: for every
potential move the computer can do, it does it and than plays random games,
sampling the number of games won and lost. Then the decision on what move to make
is made based on the move that appears to have the best won/lost ratio.

All credits for the inspirations go to Salvatore Sanfilippo.
